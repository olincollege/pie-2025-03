    <h1>Design Story</h1>
    
    <p class="subpage-description">
        From initial concept to final prototype, this is the journey of how PC Frost came to life—
        the challenges we faced, the pivots we made, and the lessons we learned along the way.

            <h2>The Beginning: Identifying the Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Our journey began in a small bakery where we observed the tedious, time-consuming 
                process of manually frosting dozens of cakes each day. Professional decorators 
                could spend 10-15 minutes per cake, and consistency was always a challenge—especially 
                during busy holiday seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                We asked ourselves: <em>What if we could automate this process while maintaining 
                the artistry and precision that makes each cake special?</em> This question became 
                the foundation of PC Frost.

            <h2>Concept Development</h2>
            <h3>Initial Brainstorming</h3>
            <p>
                Our first whiteboard sessions produced several wildly different concepts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A robotic arm with full 6-axis articulation</li>
                <li>A turntable-based system with a stationary nozzle</li>
                <li>A polar coordinate CNC system</li>
                <li>A traditional Cartesian CNC platform</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Winning Design</h3>
            <p>
                After prototyping quick mockups, we settled on the polar coordinate approach—hence 
                the "PC" in PC Frost. This design offered the perfect balance of simplicity, 
                precision, and the natural circular motion needed for cake decoration. The rotating 
                platform mimics how bakers naturally work, while the radial arm provides reach 
                and control.

            <h2>Prototype Iterations</h2>
            <h3>Prototype 1: The Cardboard Model</h3>
            <p>
                Before investing in materials, we built a full-scale cardboard model to test 
                ergonomics and basic geometry. This helped us identify workspace constraints 
                and optimal sizing for standard cake dimensions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Prototype 2: The Wobbly First Build</h3>
            <p>
                Our first functional prototype was... educational. Built with budget stepper 
                motors and 3D-printed parts, it suffered from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive vibration at anything above 20mm/s</li>
                <li>Inconsistent frosting flow due to pressure fluctuations</li>
                <li>Frame flex that destroyed our positioning accuracy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite its flaws, this prototype proved the concept was viable and gave us 
                critical data about what needed improvement.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Prototype 3: The Refinement</h3>
            <p>
                Armed with lessons learned, we rebuilt from the ground up with aluminum extrusion, 
                proper linear rails, and a regulated pneumatic system. This version finally 
                achieved the precision and reliability we needed.

            <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
            <h3>Why Polar Coordinates?</h3>
            <p>
                The polar coordinate system proved superior for circular cakes because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural circular motion reduces computational overhead</li>
                <li>Simpler G-code generation for radial patterns</li>
                <li>Better reach-to-footprint ratio compared to Cartesian systems</li>
                <li>Easier calibration with a rotating platform</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Pneumatic vs. Servo-Driven Extrusion</h3>
            <p>
                We initially considered a servo-driven piston for frosting dispensing but switched 
                to pneumatics after testing revealed that air pressure provided more consistent 
                flow control across varying frosting viscosities. The compressibility of air 
                actually worked in our favor as a buffer against pressure spikes.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Material Choices</h3>
            <p>
                Every material choice was deliberate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aluminum extrusion:</strong> Modular, rigid, and easy to modify</li>
                <li><strong>Linear rails:</strong> Low friction and high precision positioning</li>
                <li><strong>Stainless steel nozzle:</strong> Food-safe and easy to clean</li>
                <li><strong>Acrylic guards:</strong> Transparent for observation, easy to sanitize</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
            <h3>The Frosting Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Our biggest challenge was managing different frosting consistencies. Buttercream 
                behaves very differently from royal icing, and temperature fluctuations caused 
                viscosity changes mid-job.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> We developed a pressure feedback system that monitors 
                flow rate and automatically adjusts PSI to maintain consistency. We also added 
                a temperature-controlled reservoir to keep frosting at optimal working temperature.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Software Complexity</h3>
            <p>
                Converting decorative patterns into machine instructions proved more complex than 
                anticipated. We needed software that could:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Import vector graphics and convert them to toolpaths</li>
                <li>Calculate optimal travel paths to minimize time</li>
                <li>Adjust for different cake sizes automatically</li>
                <li>Preview designs before execution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> We built a custom web-based interface using JavaScript 
                and Canvas API, allowing designers to preview and adjust patterns in real-time 
                before sending to the machine.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Food Safety Concerns</h3>
            <p>
                As a food-contact device, every component in the frosting path needed to be 
                food-safe and easy to sanitize. We worked with food safety consultants to ensure 
                compliance with FDA guidelines.
            </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
            <p>
                We frosted over 200 cakes during testing, experimenting with different:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frosting recipes and viscosities</li>
                <li>Pattern complexities and speeds</li>
                <li>Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)</li>
                <li>Cake sizes from 6" to 16" diameter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our final design achieved an average frosting time of 4-6 minutes per cake 
                with professional-quality results—reducing the manual time by more than 60%.

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>
                PC Frost represents just the beginning. Future iterations could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-color frosting with automatic color switching</li>
                <li>Computer vision for automatic cake detection and centering</li>
                <li>Cloud-connected pattern library for sharing designs</li>
                <li>Scaled-up versions for industrial bakery operations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project taught us that successful engineering isn't just about technical 
                excellence—it's about understanding the user, iterating quickly, and never 
                being satisfied with "good enough."
