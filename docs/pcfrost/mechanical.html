            <h2>System Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The mechanical system consists of a three-axis CNC platform designed to 
                move a frosting nozzle in X, Y, and Z directions with precision. The frame 
                is constructed from aluminum extrusion for rigidity while maintaining a 
                lightweight profile.

            <h2>Frame Design</h2>
            <h3>Material Selection</h3>
            <p>
                We chose 2020 aluminum extrusion for the frame due to its:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High strength-to-weight ratio</li>
                <li>Easy assembly with T-slot nuts and brackets</li>
                <li>Modular design allowing for future modifications</li>
                <li>Cost-effectiveness compared to custom machined parts</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Structural Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                The base measures 600mm × 600mm, providing stability for the working area 
                of 400mm × 400mm. Corner brackets and cross-bracing prevent flex during 
                high-speed movements.
            </p>

            <h2>Motion System</h2>
            <h3>Linear Motion</h3>
            <p>
                Each axis uses linear guide rails paired with lead screws for precise 
                positioning. NEMA 17 stepper motors drive the lead screws through 
                flexible couplers to accommodate minor misalignments.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>X-axis travel: 400mm</li>
                <li>Y-axis travel: 400mm</li>
                <li>Z-axis travel: 150mm</li>
                <li>Resolution: 0.05mm per step</li>
                <li>Maximum speed: 100mm/s</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frosting Delivery System</h2>
            <p>
                The frosting is dispensed through a pneumatically-actuated syringe system 
                mounted on the Z-axis carriage. Air pressure is regulated to ensure 
                consistent flow rates across different frosting viscosities.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Key Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>60mL syringe reservoir</li>
                <li>Solenoid valve for on/off control</li>
                <li>Pressure regulator (0-30 PSI)</li>
                <li>Stainless steel nozzle (2mm diameter)</li>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Initial design had excessive vibration during rapid movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Added damping feet under the frame and implemented 
                acceleration limiting in the motion control software.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Lead screw backlash caused positioning errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Upgraded to anti-backlash nuts and implemented 
                software compensation for remaining play.
