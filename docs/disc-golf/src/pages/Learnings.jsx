            <p className="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As with any project, there are always bound to be issues and mishaps which cause designs to be reconsidered and solutions to be implemented in order to maintain workflow as well as stay on schedule. The bulk of issues can be summed into two main categories: material choice/fabrication, and design integration.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Though somewhat of a short consideration in the beginning of a project, comparatively to the other topics, material choice is paramount of justifying designs. A good design is only justified through the choice of materials to support its intended purpose.
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">

                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  The outer enclosure was designed with the choice of eucalyptus hardboard in mind. This material choice allowed for easy fabrication of what essentially were the panels of a box. Since the panels themselves were essentially a 2D consideration when looking at the enclosure as the sum of its components. Additionally, recutting extra space for new mounting holes as well as entry points for pneumatics and UI considerations were made quite facile with "euca-board" since fabricating and editing with the laser cutter is a simple task.

                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  The inner enclosure was chosen to be made out of 16 gauge mild-steel sheet metal due to the consideration of facility in cleaning the inner enclosure from all the dirt and grime flapped off of the intaken disk. Additionally a consideration was made with the top panel of the enclosure bending due to the weight load from the electronics. Additionally, sheet metal tools were easy to access out of normal shop hours, and plasma cut manufacturing, while not extremely precise due to the nature of its kerf, aided in reading areas impossible with the sheet metal tools shear force nature.
                </p>
                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  The long blade was not the most accurate tool, and the more precise angle cutter was not designed to cut stock the size which was necessary for the enclosure panels. Future considerations might lean towards plasma cutting for large cuts and then sheet metal tools for precise clean-up.

                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  In terms of all the brackets, which connected everything to the base and allowed for the enclosures to maintain shape and structure, the same mild steel was utilized, yet 22 gauge. The brackets did not require a certain thickness and are designed to hold a certain redundancy. In this vein, the same consideration of 16 gauge thickness was not needed due to the strength of the design. Fabrication was relatively simple with sheet metal tools being more maneuverable with smaller sheet metal pieces.

                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  The load-bearing grate was designed with plywood due to its multi-axial load bearing capabilities; an area where traditional wood fails often. Since normal wood has a grain structure, it is very strong to force acting in one direction in its length, yet weak when the force acts on the axis of its width. Plywood is composed of multiple sheets of wood in different directions, which allow for the strong load bearing capabilities of one direction to compensate for another sheet's weak structure in a different direction.
                </p>
                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  Finite element analysis demonstrated a strong safety factor for plywood, while traditionally wood edged on the limit of uncertainty. The grate shield was made out of aluminum sheet metal due to its same moisture wicking properties as other stock metals, yet it was less costly and weighed much less, which reduced the load the plywood grate had to suspend.

                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Most non-load-bearing components were manufactured with PLA plastic, manufactured through the FDM Prusa and Bamboo carbon 3D printers. Normal 15% infill, and level 2 perimeter settings were utilized for most non structural components. For the brush assembly brackets, the motor mount, and the grate support brackets were designed with 5-8 level perimeters, which ensured structural strength while reducing print times as PLA waste.
                </p>
                <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  For most rapid iteration, the Prusa's proximity and general availability made for facile use. Yet, the Bamboo carbons had greater accuracy, could allow for more interactive designs with less worries of failure and had shorter printing times. The only shortcoming were the open hours of the foundry, which limited its use to important components that had been designed, verified and required longer print times.

            <p className="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In terms of integration issues, there were some serious design shortcomings that matured into awkward assembly and integration issues. But PIE is all about integration and learning that there will never be a lack of issues to come forward. The key process is to identify the issues, what caused them, how to solve them in the short term, and then how to implement long term solutions that allow for more redundant design verification.

                <p className="text-amber-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  One issue that had no structural issues but caused some annoyance with aesthetics was the inaccuracy of certain given objects. For example, the base was originally measured to be of a certain length, which was demonstrated on the design, but when the panels were fabricated and installed to create the enclosure, there was a discrepancy between the design and reality: the base board was slightly wider than measured. This caused the side panels to flare-out slightly at the bottom, which was a big enough annoyance to be perceivable, yet small enough to not merit redesign and acquisition of new manufacturing materials.
                </p>
                <p className="text-amber-800 text-sm leading-relaxed mt-2">
                  Additionally, many electronics and hinges utilized did not have any schematics or CAD models, which made designing their mounting points more difficult and imprecise since the value that the design followed were based off of caliper readings.

                <p className="text-red-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  One consideration not made that came back as an issue during electrical testing was the inner enclosure's electrical conductivity, due to the nature of mild steel. This caused issues with noise, inconsistent power distortion, and generally many unknown problems that were only resolved due to the implementation of electrical tape as a second layer to the electronics. Future considerations for electronics mounting might include a thin sheet of rubber or any other electric insulator.

                <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Another issue with integration was a separation between the chuck assembly design and the rest of the mechanical assembly, since the latter was wholly unaware of the smaller details of the chuck assembly, there was much testing which led to mechanical issues that needed to be repaired quite late in the process. This delayed testing and caused issues with creating a minimum viable product. Future considerations would be to consolidate designs continually through more mechanical meetings.
                </p>

                <p className="text-purple-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                  Finally, integrating electronics as well as the interfaces to interact with their end-points, the motor actuations, was difficult due to sudden needs for mechanical changes, which required disassembly and subtractive manufacturing. One such case was the additional need of integration of a switch that allowed the chuck motor to change direction and allow for the chuck to tighten around a disc and loosen to allow the disc to be collected. This could not be done programmatically and needed a physical switch for the user to do so. While the actual integration of a print mounting design as well as spacing consideration on the front panel was not difficult in of itself, disassembling the front panel was time consuming and dragged members away from other tasks.
