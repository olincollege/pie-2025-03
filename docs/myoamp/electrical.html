      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of the Electrical system of MyoAmp was to read surface Electromyography Signals from the user’s arm, getting this data to the 
        pico, and actuating the linear actuators responsible for closing the user’s hand. There are a couple components of the electrical design 
        that allow it to properly do this. Those components are the battery management, sensor data, and mechanical actuation. Due to a common 
        ground the system components will draw whatever power they need to.

          the user contracts their pinky and ring fingers. There is also a moderately strong sEMG reading when the index and middle fingers are 
          contracted. The difference in signal strength allows us to differentiate between the fingers with just this one sensor. </p>

      <h3>Troubleshooting and Next Steps</h3>
      <p> Throughout the process of creating the electrical system for MyoAmp we had to troubleshoot many things. </p>
        <p>
        First, we accidentally put too much current into the sEMG sensors due to a lack of overcurrent protection. We accounted for this 
        error by adding current limiting and filtering to make sure that the sensors were getting a safe consistent 3 volts.
        </p>
        <p>
       Second, the TB6612FNG motor driver was not powerful enough to drive 2 linear actuators so the TB6612FNG motor driver ended up breaking. 
       In the future we will replace the TB612FNG motor driver with a motor driver that is powerful enough. On top of this our second motor driver
        never shipped to us and we ended up using a different motor driver, although it worked, it would be better if we used the same motor 
        drivers throughout the project for reliability and troubleshooting purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Third, one of our buck converters stopped working when we accidentally put too much current into the sEMG sensors and we don’t know why. 
        We assume that it is an error with the buck converters we got so our next steps are to integrate a custom buck converter onto the 
        perfboard itself rather than relying on  an external module. To get around this error with the limited time we had we had to rely on a 
        portable charger to power the raspberry pi pico.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our next steps for the electrical subsystem would be to integrate custom buck converters onto a custom PCB to minimize the space taken up 
        by the electrical board. We would also choose a new motor driver that can handle driving the 3 linear actuators.
