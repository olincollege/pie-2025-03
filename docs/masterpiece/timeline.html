            <p>
                In this sprint, we aimed to validate our idea and implementation by running several mechanical, electrical, and software tests. Mechanically, our goal for Sprint 1 was to prototype a 3-by-3 array of Hall Effect sensors in a 3D print. The goal was to test the functionality of the sensors and ensure that we could work on our stretch goal simultaneously. At the same time, we were researching different gantries and their specific use cases, as well as their flaws, and had a rough design idea. For software, we focused on the internal tracking and interpretation of the board. We selected the Python Chess library and Stockfish engine for our gameplay, and designed 3 board representations that could track the digital game, track the physical board, and plan paths for the gantry to follow. Since the gantry didn’t exist during this sprint, we created a digital simulation of moves that would occur on the physical board.

                We settled on a gantry design and modified it to suit our specific needs. We also built our designed gantry and tested the
            A large focus during this time was on the path planning for each move. When the gantry was still not prepared, we used the simulation code to plot how moves would occur and debugged the order of operations for each kind of move and edge case. Generating G-code from these planned move sequences was quite simple since one node of movement corresponded to one inch on the board. Once the gantry was ready, we calibrated it to move the correct distance for a given input, and practiced drawing basic shapes to validate our work. During this time, the Raspberry Pi was also configured with the repository, and we confirmed communication between both of our microcontrollers.

            <p>
                For sprint 3, we met our goal for the project of having a board that plays computer versus computer chess. By mounting the board on top of the gantry, printing and assembling the end-effector, and printing all the pieces, we were able to conduct games on the physical board. To get the software ready, we created a turn-based game loop for the physical board, ensured correct end-effector servo control, and debugged all G-code-related functions. For the next sprint, we aimed to get a board reset function done and to solder and mount our PCBs to achieve our stretch goal of detecting human movement and having a human versus computer chess.
